## The history

After I have spent a lot of time on photography and cameras [in the past](../my_personal_photography_history), I almost gave up on more ambitious photography in recent years. On the one hand because there is not so much spare time on hand for a young father. On the other hand due to the fact the cameras in our pockets (i.e. smartphones) got so incredibly good and thus reduce the need for a bulky DSLR.

Now some new technological developments - mainly camera hardware and editing software solutions - converged to a really promising package that convinced me to step into a dedicated camera setup again.

## The requirements

My requirements were that this package had to be portable, deliver really high quality photos (otherwise there is no point choosing a camera over a smartphone) and it should be „lean“ in the sense that the whole workflow is as simple and frictionless as possible. I did not look for the cheapest option, but one that really delivers on my requirements.

My type of photography can be described as rather casual. I want to take nice pictures of our family, of hiking trips and travel and from time to time spend some time to do more artistic landscape and nature photography. 

## The solution

Considering all of the above, I have found the almost perfect setup for me by using
- the Sony A7C  - the smallest full-frame interchangeable lens camera on the market 
- [the Sony FE 1.8/35mm](../sony_sel35f18f_review/) - a compact and versatile lens with great optical quality
- [the Sony FE 1.8/85mm](../sony_sel85f18_review/) - same as the 35 but at 85mm
- [the Sony FE 4-5.6/28-60mm](../sony_sel2860_review/) - tiny and optically quite good (travel-)zoom
- [Adobe Lightroom](../raw_workflow_with_adobe_lightroom/) (on iPad, PC and iPhone) - powerful RAW workflow tool that keeps the complexity of storing, synching and backing up your photos in the background by a robust cloud sychronisation
- [Apple MacBook Pro 14"](../apple_macbook_pro_m1pro_for_personal_and_casual_photography_use) - a solid and extremely capable laptop for photographers' use, in tandem with an [Apple iPad Air](../can_the_ipad_replace_a_laptop_macbook_pro_ipad_air_m2)

## The outlook

In the coming weeks I will describe in a bit more detail why I have chosen this setup and provide some considerations for other casual photographers that want exceptional quality in a practical and lean setup.

For the time being, let's start with some pictures from the setup above. Click to access the _full-sized_ JPEGs (exported from Lightroom).
