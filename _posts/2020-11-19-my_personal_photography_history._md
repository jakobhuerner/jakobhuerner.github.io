excerpt: A look back at almost 20 years of digtial photography, photo equipment and photo sharing
---

My personal history of digital photography and photo sharing started almost 20 years ago (even suprises me when thinking about it). I started photography with mainly technology interest in the beginning, and this is up to this day a diriving factor for me. I like tech and nice equipment, the with the "artistic" side of photography developed over time. So my look back in this post also focuses the equipment side in the beginning.

Maybe this tech-driven approach is also the reason why I was never interested in analogue photography. In fact, I never really used an analogue camera and film. My entry into photography was digital from day one.

### 2001

This day one was in summer 2001, when I got my first digital camera, the Sony DSC-P1. I was 13 years old back then, and I guess my marks in school must have been quite decent. I was actually one of the first people who had a digital camera in my hometown. This was a thing back then, unbelievable today.

The [DSC-P1](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/sonydscp1) was already a quite nice and usable camera. It features a 3 MPx sensor and a 3x zoom lens and saved images on a 8 MB flash drive, which I later replaced with a 64 MB one.
The first photo with the camera I deleted obviously, but here's the file called "DSC00002.JPG"

### 2003

Within two years later my interest in photography grow that I wanted to get more serious about camera equipment. In this time the [Minolta DiMAGE 7i](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/minoltadimage7i) was a hot and still affordable camera. Better image quality, a nice 28-200 equiv. lens and a cool look made me spend my saved money on this new camera. I think, this was the actual step into more ambitious photography for me. Image results with this camera were already quite nice. The big weakpoint were the batteries, a set of 4 AA NiMH batteries was good for 50 pictures or so. Meaning, you always better off having 12, or in winter conditions better 15 batteries in your bag.

In this year I also started sharing my pictures online using a personal blog - long before this term was really understood or used at least in Austria. :-)
It started with some html pages and overcompressed jpeg images, but it created some attention within my personal environment. Sharing images publicly globally within minutes was something completely new back then.
I still remember how my first website looked, unfortunately I have not archived the pages back then.

### 2004

My big wish at this time was a DSLR camera, which was not reachable for me due to the price of such an equipment back then. However, in 2003 things came together: Canon released a stripped-down amateur version of their semiprofessional DSLR model; I earned some (little) money with photography already and had found someone who wanted to purchase my Minolta. That was the perfect opportunity to step up the ladder and go for a DSLR, the [Canon EOS 300D](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canoneos300d).
Quite quickly it became clear that the key ingredient for a good photography setup are the lenses.

Forums

### 2006

Sharing photos became more and more important to me. It helped me in my photography journey also by getting feedback from different people both online and offline. To acocunt for that, I needed to upgrade my photography blog technically and chose to switched to Wordpress. The Wordpress project was 3 years old back then and not as ubiquitous as today. 

Photography equipment-wise my setup grew to a fine assortment of quite cool equipment that kept quite stable for several years to come. Canon EOS EOS 30D, Canon EF 4/17-40mm L, Canon EF 4/70-200mm L IS, Canon EF 1.4/50mm, Sigma 2.8/90mm Makro and the EOS 300D as backup (I haven't sold it by today due to nostalgic feeling ...)

### 2013

Casual style -- sold all DSLR equipment (except the 300D) and chose to go for a really compact, APS-C sensor Sony NEX-3N with a small but nice 16-50mm lens.
