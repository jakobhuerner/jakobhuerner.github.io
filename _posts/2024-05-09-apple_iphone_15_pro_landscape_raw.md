You might have seen my recent pictures from [Aggstein Castle](../aggstein). They were taken with the cameras of the iPhone 15 Pro.

I took the last picture with the iPhone's main camera, which features a (for a phone) decently sized lens and a  48 MPx image sensor.
For the image I used the RAW setting of the built-in camera app and converted the "ProRAW" file to JPG with Lightroom.

In my opinion the image quality is just great. Moreover, it gets almost unbelievable if you zoom into the picture. At 100%, the level of detail you get from this smartphone camera is simply mind blowing.

The gap between dedicated photo cameras like [full-frame mirrorless systems](../leanest_highest_quality_casual_photography_setup/)) and smartphones keeps closing.
