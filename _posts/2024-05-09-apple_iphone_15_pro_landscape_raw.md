You might have seen my recent pictures from [Aggstein Castle](../aggstein). They were taken with the cameras of the iPhone 15 Pro.

The last picture was taken with the iPhone's main camera, which features a (for a phone) decently sized lens and a  48 MPx image sensor.
For this image I used the RAW setting and converted the "ProRAW" file to JPG with Lightroom.

I think the image quality is just great. Moreover, it gets really impressive, maybe unbelievable, if you zoom into the picture. At 100%, the level of detail you get from this smartphone camera is simply mindblowing.

It is still the case that for maximum photographic freedom and overall image quality - and fun - you will go for a dedicated camera (e.g. [full frame mirrorless](../leanest_highest_quality_casual_photography_setup/)). For the vast majority of photos your smartphone, however, will do the job just as good.
