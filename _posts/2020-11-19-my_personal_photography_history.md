excerpt: A look back at almost 20 years of digtial photography and photo sharing

My personal history of digital photography and photo sharing started almost 20 years ago (even suprises me when thinking about it).
In fact, I never really used an analogue camera and film. My entry into photography was digital from day one.

### 2001

This day one was in summer 2001, when I got my first digital camera, the Sony DSC-P1. I was 13 years old back then, and I guess my marks in school must have been quite decent. I was actually one of the first people who had a digital camera in my hometown. This was a thing back then, unbelievable today.
The [DSC-P1](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/sonydscp1) was already a quite nice and usable camera. It features a 3 MPx sensor and a 3x zoom lens and saved images on a 8 MB flash drive, which I later replaced with a 64 MB one.
The first photo with the camera I deleted obviously, but here's the file called "DSC00002.JPG"

### 2003

In this year I started sharing my pictures online using a personal blog - long before this term was really understood or used at least in Austria. :-)
It started with some html pages and overcompressed jpeg images, but it created some attention within my personal environment. Sharing images publicly globally within minutes was something completely new back then.
I still remember how my first website looked, unfortunately I have not archived the pages back then.
