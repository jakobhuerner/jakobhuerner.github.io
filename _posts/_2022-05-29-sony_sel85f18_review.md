The following lines reflect my impressions on the Sony FE 1.8/35mm, which I use in combination with the Sony A7C.
As [written before](../leanest_highest_quality_casual_photography_setup/), I would describe my kind of photography not as ultra-ambitious, but as __casual__ paired with a high expectation to image quality. 

Coming from this direction it means for me, that I need a lens for everyday use which is both portable enough not to be a burden and optically excellent. I have found this for the Sony A7C full-frame camera with the Sony FE 1.8/35mm.

## Plus and minus

What I like:
- Autofocus: the AF is very fast, silent and accurate, it can keep up with tracking the moves of a three-year-old with ease.
- Build quality: the look and feel is very solid, Sony also promises basic water-resistance.
- Sharpness: The lens is very sharp, starting at F1.8 and even improving with stopping down to f2.8. 

What I do not like:
- Minimum focus distance: with a minimum focus distance of 0,8m you often reach the closest limit. (For [close ups](../spring_blossoms/)  I use simple extension tubes - these make the lens a nice and cost-effective macro option.)
- Vignetting: the edges of the frame are notably darker at F1.8, which is however easily controllable with automated lens corrections in Lightroom.
- CA: especially wide open there are purple fringes at high-contrast edges.

## My conclusion

I am impressed by this lens. If I compare it to similar mid-range lenses that I used for years on my Canons, this lens plays in another league. I am personally very much into sharpness as central optical quality, and I was used to stopping down fast lenses at least one full aperture stop for good sharpness. Not this one, concerning sharpness at all apertures this lens scores 10/10 for me.

Overall, the 1.8/35mm on the A7C delivers the perfect all-rounder package for me, with portability and excellent image quality at a handy focal length for everyday use.
