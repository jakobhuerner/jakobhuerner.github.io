After [last year](../summer_holiday_mostviertel) we enjoyed summer in Austria this year as well. Short distances, no airport stress, beautiful and diverse landscapes and great food. What more can you ask for?

(Maybe getting around sustainably, powered by renewable energy only … box ticked as well this year. ;) )
