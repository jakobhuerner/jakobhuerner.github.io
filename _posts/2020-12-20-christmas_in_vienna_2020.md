excerpt: Christmas in Vienna is almost the same as always but different this time
---
Christmas time in Vienna is nice, some say even magic. Both Vienna residents and tourists enjoy the weeks before Christmas for strolling through the city, having Gl√ºhwein and do some christmas shopping. Normally.
This year the decorated city looks almost similar to a year ago, but feels totally different.
