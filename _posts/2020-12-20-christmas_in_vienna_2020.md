The Christmas season in Vienna is beautiful, some even say magical. Both Vienna residents and tourists enjoy the weeks before Christmas for strolling through the city, having Gl√ºhwein and do some Christmas shopping. Normally.
This year, the decorated city looks almost the same as a year ago, but feels totally different.

In the end, I found something that was truly the same as last year. Something to hold on to. ;)
