After my school and university education within technology and industrial engineering I started my career in an international group in the steel industry. In the course of 10 exciting years I had different roles in various functions within industrial management, based at the group's Vienna headquarters and production site in Sweden.

Over the years I developed a stronger interest in all things digital, both by taking on roles concerning digitalisation and by postgraduate education in Data Science.

In the course of my career I helped shaping activities and programs increasing efficiency and environmental footprint of the company group, developing teams and programs within the global company network and establishing completely new capability fields within those teams. 

## My strength

I see my core strength in "connecting the dots". I am always interested in understanding systems, its actors and how the different parts are connected. Only by understanding systems and their dynamics, you are able to effectively shape them in a permanent and sustainable way.
