After my school and university education within technology and industrial engineering I started my career in an international group in the steel industry. While already 10 with the company, I had a wide variety of roles within industrial management, based at the group's Vienna headquarters and a production site in Sweden.

Over the years I developed an increasing interest in all things digital, both by taking on roles concerning digitalisation and by postgraduate education in Data Science.

In the course of my career I helped shaping activities and programs that significantly increase efficiency and reduce the environmental footprint of the company group. I develop teams and programs within the global company network and establish completely new capability fields for the group. 

## My strength

I see my core strength in "connecting the dots". I am always interested in understanding systems below the surface, the systems' actors and their connections. Only by understanding systems and their dynamics, you are able to effectively shape them in a permanent and sustainable way.
