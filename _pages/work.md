After my school and university education within technology and industrial engineering I started my career in an international group in the steel industry. While staying already 10 with the company, I had a a wide variety of roles within industrial management, based at the group's Vienna headquarters and production site in Sweden.

Over the years I developed a stronger interest in all things digital, both by taking on roles concerning digitalisation and by postgraduate education in Data Science.

In the course of my career I helped shaping activities and programs that significantly increase efficiency and the environmental footprint of the company group. I develop teams and programs within the global company network and established completely new capability fields for the group. 

## My strength

I see my core strength in "connecting the dots". I am always interested in understanding systems behind the surface, the systems' actors and their connections. Only by understanding systems and their dynamics, you are able to effectively shape them in a permanent and sustainable way.

I am writing about various aspects of my work in my [professional blog on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/welcome-jakobs-linkedin-blog-updated-lists-all-posts-jakob-h%C3%BCrner/") - check it ou!

It no only help me reflect on challenges and my development at work. I also want to share my experiences with others so they benefit from it.
