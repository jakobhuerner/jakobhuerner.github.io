## Where should I start?

I recommend to start with a photographic trip through the seasons!

- Starting with [winter](../easter_sunday_winter_lunz_2021/),
- continuing with [spring](../spring_forest/),
- and when [summer](../waldviertel_impressions/) is in full glory,
- [autumn](../autumn/) is soon here as well.

Or you read some history lessons about [how I got into photography](../my_personal_photography_history/).
