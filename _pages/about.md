Focus: How casual photographers can make their photographic lives remarkably lean & easy nowadays, allowing them to focus more on the __moment__ (pictures), and less on __things__ (equipment).

## Where should I start?

I recommend to start with a photographic trip through the seasons!

- Starting with [winter](../easter_sunday_winter_lunz_2021/),
- continuing with [spring](https://jakobhuerner.github.io/spring_forest/),
- and when [summer](https://jakobhuerner.github.io/waldviertel_impressions/) is in full glory,
- [autumn](https://jakobhuerner.github.io/autumn/) is soon here as well.
